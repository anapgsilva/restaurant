### Add-ons

The front end of this application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was also used for icons.

[STRIPE](https://stripe.com/docs/development) was integrated for the card payment method, using the npm package [react-stripe-checkout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-stripe-checkout) and the rails gem stripe.

The back end was built on Ruby on Rails, using [Knock](https://dev.to/amckean12/user-authentication-for-a-rails-api-and-a-react-client-part-1-server-side-3fej) for user authentication (Rails JWT gem version).

[Rack-cors](https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors) was used for communication between front and back end.
